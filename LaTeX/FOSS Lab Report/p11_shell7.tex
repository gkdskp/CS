    # Write a script that compares two directories dir1 and dir2(supplied as
    # arguments) and copies to dir1 from dir2 every file that is not present in
    # dir1.

    if [[ $# -ne 2 ]]
    then
        echo "Insufficient number of arguments"
        exit
    fi

    if [[ !(-d $1) || !(-d $2) ]]
    then
        echo "Invalid arguments. Please enter directory names"
        exit
    fi

    diff $1 $2 | grep "$1" | awk '{for(i = 4; i <= NF; i++) printf "%s ",$i; printf "\n"}' |
    while read filename
    do
        cp "$1/$filename" $2
        echo "Copied $filename"
    done
