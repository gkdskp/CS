# Write a script called addnames that is to be called as follows ./addnames ulist username
# Here ulist is the name of the file that contains list of user names and username is a
# particular studentâ€™s username. The script should
#	i) check that the correct number of arguments was received and print a message, in
#    case the number of arguments is incorrect
#   ii) check whether the ulist file exists and print an error message if it does not
#   iii) check whether the username already exists in the file. If the username exists, print
#    a message stating that the name already exists. Otherwise, add the username to the
#    end of the list
